              Our performance under these Terms is subject to existing laws and

              or information provided to, or gathered by, us with respect to

              you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or
              relating to your access or use of this Service within two (2)

              These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may

              If any provision of these Terms, including, but not limited to,
              the warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth
              above, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under
              applicable law, the invalid or unenforceable provisions in these
              Terms shall be deemed superseded by valid and enforceable
              provisions that, to the extent possible, fulfill the business
              purposes and intent of such invalid and unenforceable provisions.

              In addition to and without limiting the preceding paragraph, some
              U.S. states and foreign countries may provide rights in addition
              to those provided in the above "Disclaimers and Limitation of
              Liability" section or do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
              implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential
              damages. Therefore, the limitations set forth in the above
              Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability section may not apply to
              you in whole or in part or there may be state or country specific
              provisions that supersede such limitations in whole or in part.
              Any provision of the above Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
              section that is declared invalid shall be deemed severable and
              shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder.
